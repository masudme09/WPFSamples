# WorkSamples
This repo contains my work samples for C# development.
1. PDFSecure : Its a project to convert PDF to image PDF with bunch of other functionalities to make pdf secure. I have added demo of the project as sample. Actual project is private.

2. PowerPointStudio: This is a powerpoint addin that can convert slides into JSON and create JSON to HTML after that. Aim is to parse the JSON with other web based framework like React to view slide online. Except this feature, some other exiting features are also in pipeline to implement. For example, creating animation by draging on powerpoint and record it as JSON. Later render it with React and in tool play button.

3. StoreAppDemo: ASP.NET MVC sample demo for ecommerce with XML parsing for data.
